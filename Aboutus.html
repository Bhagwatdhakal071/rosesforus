    <h2>Topic for Research</h2>
    <h5>Artificial Intelligence Based Web Portal of Flower</h5>
    <p>
      In this research, we will build an Artificial Intelligence based web
      portal for growing flowers. The website is unique that it targets for
      garden beginners in Texas, and can give recommendations based on user's
      preference. We will include around 100 species, divided by categories of
      annuals and perennials. Particularly we will have special categories of
      roses, cactus and orchids. We will have special categories of climbers.
      For each plant, we will have information about color category, growing
      easiness, care tips, blooming periods, budget range, and possible
      nurseries. Images and videos will be utilized. Moreover, we will have an
      artificial intelligence based component built on database, to give
      recommendations, based on user's preference.The proposed research will
      support Department of Computer Science and Engineering Technology as
      Computer Science program have just launched a newly approved Master's
      program, Master's in Artificial Intelligence. The research work will
      involve around 80 students taking Web Programming class each Fall so that
      they will apply their knowledge to benefit the community in a very
      practical way. The research involves novel algorithms in Database
      Searching, Artificial Intelligence and Web Programming, as booming areas
      in computer science for people's everyday use. The algorithm and the
      project can result in patents, in Artificial Intelligence and Web
      Programming.
